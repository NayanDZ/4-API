# 4-API/Web Services

## API

- Application Programming Interface (API) is a software intermediary that allows your applications to communicate with one another. 
It provides routines, protocols, and tools for developers building software applications, while enabling the extraction and sharing of data in an accessible manner.

- Content formats of API is JSON, XML, plain text, JPEG, PDF etc.

## Web Services     

- A web service is software composed of standardized XML messaging system.
- The benefit of web services are since all of its communication is in XML, they are not restricted to any operating system or programming languages
- Web services are built on top of open standards such as XML, Java, HTTP, TCP/IP.
 
## API vs Web Services 

Majorly two types of services used in the development environment REST and SOAP 
1. REST (Representational State Transfer) uses HTTP to obtain data and perform operations on remote computer systems. It supports SSL authentication and HTTPS to achieve secure communication.

  REST uses the JSON standard

2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is an XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging information among computers. 
SOAPâ€™s built-in WS-Security standard uses XML Encryption, XML Signature, and SAML tokens to deal with transactional messaging security considerations.

  Web services depends on
  - XML: to tag the data (as markup and syntax)
  - SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol): to transfer a message
  - WSDL(Web Services Description Language): to describe the availability of service
  - UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration): Registry service is a Web service that manages information about service providers, service implementations, and service metadata
